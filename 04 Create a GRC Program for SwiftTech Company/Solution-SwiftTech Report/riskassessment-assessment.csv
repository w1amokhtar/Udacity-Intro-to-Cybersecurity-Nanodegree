Security Risk Assessment,,,,,,,,
Risk #,Risk ,Risk Family,Control,Liklihood,Impact,Reasoning,Mitigating Controls,Total Risk Score
1,AES-128 is a weak encryption algorithm ,data encryption ,VPC3 File storage only supports AES-128 Encryption,High ,High,AES-128 has been shown to be easy to crack. Anyone with little experience can crack the encryption ,use a stronger encryption algorithm like AES-256,High 
2,unencrypted data is at risk of exposure or tamper once it's accessed ,data encryption ,Databases in production are unencrypted,medium  ,high,"the database contains sensitive information. Once it's exposed, many parties will be negatively affected ",encrypt the database,High 
2b,unencrypted data is at risk of exposure or tamper once it's accessed ,,Databases in production are unencrypted,medium  ,high,"the database contains sensitive information. Once it's exposed, many parties will be negatively affected ",encrypt the database,High 
3,7-character password is too short and can be cracked easily ,user access,Internal network users require a 7-character password,medium  ,High ,password cracking tools are powerful enough to crack short passwords especially if they are not complicated.  ,change password policy to require longer and stronger passwords ,high 
4,never expiring passwords gives the attacker more time to guess the password ,user access,Passwords never expire,medium  ,High ,"passwords are means to access the system. Once they are obtained, the attacker can obtain access and harm the system or its users ",set a password expiration period ,high 
5,anyone can access the system remotely if they have valid credentials ,user access,VPN Access does not require MFA,high ,high ,once credential are obtained. Attacker can access the network remotely and perform an attack or steal information ,apply multifactor authentication to VPN access ,high 
6,TLS v1.1 contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited ,network security ,TLS V1.1 is used between the cloud production environment and SwiftTechâ€™s physical location,medium  ,medium ,TLS has known vulnerabilities that can be explained to access information transferred on the network ,use TLS v1.2 or higher,medium 
7,"if there is an attack on one of the tiers, the the th other tier will also be affected (single point of failure)",Network/ software Security ,Application development Tiers are not logically segmented from Business Application servers,medium  ,medium ,having a single point of failure means that the system is as strong as its weakest tier which requires all components to be highly secured to prevent attacks ,logically separate tiers ,medium 
7b,"if there is an attack on one of the tiers, the the th other tier will also be affected (single point of failure)",Network/ software Security ,Application development Tiers are not logically segmented from Business Application servers,medium  ,medium ,having a single point of failure means that the system is as strong as its weakest tier which requires all components to be highly secured to prevent attacks ,logically separate tiers ,medium 
8,known vulnerabilities can be exploited easily ,system security  ,Development Tier servers are unpatched and contain multiple vulnerabilities,medium  ,medium ,the impact depends on the score of the vulnerability. If it's high then the risk will be high too.  ,regularly update and patch the development servers ,medium 
9,deploying an application without scanning it first means that we are letting the attackers be the first ones to find vulnerabilities ,Software Security ,Application code is not scanned for vulnerabilities before being published into production environment,high ,high , The application may gain a bad reputation and become unusable because attackers are exploiting all the vulnerabilities that could have been fixed by scanning the application before deployment ,perform penetration testing before deployment ,high

Notes:,,,,,,,,
Risk - descriptions should be some reasonable approximation of what is written above but does not need to be exact,,,,,,,,
"Reasoning - The reasoning should approximately match to the user's assessment of the likelihood and impact of a potential risk.  If, for instance the likelihood and impact are marked high, the reasoning should reflect why it might be high",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Mitigating Controls - For the purpose of this exercise we did not include mitigating controls,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Total Risk Score - Should not be less than a reasonable approximation of the likelihood x impact.  For instance, if L=High and I=High (and no mitigating control exists) then Risk cannot equal Low",,,,,,,,
